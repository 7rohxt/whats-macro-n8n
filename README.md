## How It Works

1. **WhatsApp Trigger**: The workflow starts when a new message (text, image, or audio) is received on WhatsApp.
2. **Switch Node**: Determines the type of message (text, image, or audio) and routes it accordingly.
3. **Image Path**:
   - Downloads the image.
   - Sends it to an HTTP request for analysis.
   - Extracts calories information.
   - Updates Google Sheets with the food entry.
   - Reads back data from the sheet and sends it to the AI model for response generation.
4. **Audio Path**:
   - Downloads the audio message.
   - Transcribes it to text.
   - Processes it with AI to extract user requests.
   - Updates Google Sheets and aggregates data for AI response.
5. **Text Request Path**:
   - Edits fields as needed.
   - Reads Google Sheets for userâ€™s food history.
   - Merges with aggregated data.
   - AI agent generates a personalized response.
6. **Response**:
   - The AI-generated message is sent back to the user via WhatsApp.

## Key Components

- **Download media**: Fetch images or audio messages from WhatsApp.
- **HTTP Request**: Communicate with APIs for analysis.
- **Edit Fields**: Preprocess or enrich the data before storing.
- **Google Sheets**: Stores and retrieves user food history.
- **Aggregate & Merge**: Combine historical data for AI analysis.
- **AI Agent**: Generates dietary advice and responses.
- **Send Message**: Responds to the user on WhatsApp.
